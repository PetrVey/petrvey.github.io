The flood risk maps are important tools for the state government authorities to provide information for residents about potential flooding danger. The aim of this study is to develop a flood risk map as the combination of vulnerability and hazard in the study area of Shanhua district located in Tainan city to understand the influence of different return period discharge, vulnerability resolution, and vulnerability weighting on final risk.

The flood hazard was based on water depth which was calculated by HEC-RAS hydraulic model in 2D. Five typhoons were used for model calibration.

Three different vulnerability importance weightings were applied to generate flood vulnerability maps. Two machine learning models, classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF), were selected for feature importance calculation in this study. The machine learning results were compared with the weighted importance obtained from an Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) procedure for performance evaluation, where a total of 16 questioner respondents participated in the survey. The vulnerability indexes were selected based on literature review and data availability in the study area.

The feasibility of the proposed approach was evaluated by pair-wise comparison of two different resolutions 25m and 100m of vulnerability and hazard maps.

Fist, findings from vulnerability maps indicated that CART model tended to small overestimate, and RF, on the other hand, tended to largely overestimate AHP result. Second, the vulnerability resolution had a much larger impact due to fact that rougher resolution accommodated more households. Lastly, finer flood model resolution provided more precise results in urban areas and extended risk zones.
